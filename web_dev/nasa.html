<p>The NASA Earth &amp; Space Air Prize is a public competition being conducted with the support of the <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/" target="_blank">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a>. The competition focuses on catalyzing the development of easy to maintain, small, and affordable aerosol sensor technology. The competition asks individuals, teams, and organizations that meet the <a href="#rules"><u>eligibility criteria</u></a> to design and develop specialized sensor technology that has the potential to be useful in spaceflight as well as on Earth anywhere outdoors in a community where pedestrians may be exposed to airborne particle matter.</p>

<p>NASA has identified particulate monitoring as a gap in its technology roadmap to enable future long-term missions. Current technology does not provide the level of sensitivity, the longevity, or the ability to operate in a reduced-gravity environment. The added bonus of this technology demonstration competition is the potential benefit to human health on Earth as well as in space.</p>

<p>The NASA Earth &amp; Space Air Prize is a public competition being conducted with the support of the <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/" target="_blank">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a>. The competition focuses on catalyzing the development of easy to maintain, small, and affordable aerosol sensor technology. The competition asks individuals, teams, and organizations that meet the <a href="#rules"><u>eligibility criteria</u></a> to design and develop specialized sensor technology that has the potential to be useful in spaceflight as well as on Earth anywhere outdoors in a community where pedestrians may be exposed to airborne particle matter.</p>

<p>NASA has identified particulate monitoring as a gap in its technology roadmap to enable future long-term missions. Current technology does not provide the level of sensitivity, the longevity, or the ability to operate in a reduced-gravity environment. The added bonus of this technology demonstration competition is the potential benefit to human health on Earth as well as in space.</p>

<p>The NASA Earth &amp; Space Air Prize is a public competition being conducted with the support of the <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/" target="_blank">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a>. The competition focuses on catalyzing the development of easy to maintain, small, and affordable aerosol sensor technology. The competition asks individuals, teams, and organizations that meet the <a href="#rules"><u>eligibility criteria</u></a> to design and develop specialized sensor technology that has the potential to be useful in spaceflight as well as on Earth anywhere outdoors in a community where pedestrians may be exposed to airborne particle matter.</p>

<p>NASA has identified particulate monitoring as a gap in its technology roadmap to enable future long-term missions. Current technology does not provide the level of sensitivity, the longevity, or the ability to operate in a reduced-gravity environment. The added bonus of this technology demonstration competition is the potential benefit to human health on Earth as well as in space.</p>
